## Project Requirements

### Hardware
1. 

### Software
1. Ranger controls the desired heading of the gondola.
2. Compass controls the spin direction of the tail fans.
3. Gains entered with the keypad or keyboard (*as in one or the other, or as in both must be functioning?*)
4. Desired heading initially set using keypad or keyboard, but modified using the ranger. There should be a **neutral height** setting to work around.
5. Pulse width for tail fan based on error of desired heading and actual heading (which is measured by the compass).
